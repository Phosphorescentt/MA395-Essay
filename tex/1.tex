Networks in the technical sense are analogous to networks in the nontechnical sense - a collection of objects paired with a number of connections that can link any two objects. \emph{Networks: An Introduction} by \emph{Mark Newman} lists \emph{Technological Networks}, \emph{Social Networks}, \emph{Information Networks} and \emph{Biological Networks} as different systems that are modelled by the technical interpretation of a network.\cite[Contents]{newman10}. A brief example of a network would be something like the following: Imagine you and your friends are represented as dots (nodes or vertices) on a piece of paper. Then if any two people are friends, the dots representing those people are connected by a line (edge). If you then repeat this process by asking your friends to list all their friends and so on, you will end up with a simple model of a \emph{social network}.

As one might imagine, now that we have this model it's easy to be curious about any structure that emerges that we can detect and abuse to develop an understanding of the real world system that we are representing. The structure that this essay will explore is that of \emph{communities}. Vaguely speaking, communities are subsets of a network that are \emph{densely connected} amongst themselves. I.e. there is some notion of any node within a community being more closely connected to other nodes in the community than nodes outside the community in the average case. Before we dive into the details of communities and detecting them, I wish to provide some motivation by way of example of the kinds of situations that networks can arise and why they are the natural model for the related systems.

\subsection{Social Networks}\label{sec:Social Networks}
\todo[backgroundcolor=yellow]{SEC: Models of Networks}
To better illustrate the simple notion of a social network mentioned above, I will introduce the canonical community detection example of \emph{Zachary's Karate Club}. Zachary's Karate Club is a dataset where ``The data was collected from the members of a university karate club by Wayne Zachary in 1977.  Each node represents a member of the club, and each edge represents a tie between two members of the club."\cite[Metadata]{konect:2017:ucidata-zachary}\todo[backgroundcolor=brown]{Am I supposed/allowed to reference like this?}. In Figure \ref{fig:zachary_digrams}, there are two different renderings of the Zachary Karate Club. Figure \ref{fig:zachary_spring} shows the network rendered using a ``spring" layout (which is a type of force directed graph drawing\cite{kobourov12})and figure \ref{fig:zachary_circle} shows the network rendered using a ``circle" layout. These different layouts show us different parts of the underlying structure of the network. \todo[backgroundcolor=brown]{Should I include any code that I write too even if it's just a small example like this?} For example, in Figure \ref{fig:zachary_spring}, it's clear which nodes in the network have the highest degree and which are of lower degree. It also allows you to see some of the community structure in the network. Meanwhile, in Figure \ref{fig:zachary_circle}, it's much easier to see the which nodes edges in the network would need to be removed to disconnect the network in a minimal way. The reason this dataset is the canonical example of community detection is that the question that comes with it is the following: Suppose two members of the club have a disagreement which causes the club to split in two. How does the club split? In Zachary's original paper on the topic \emph{An Information Flow Model for Conflict in Small Groups}\cite{zachary77} he uses community detection techniques to predict how the network will split after the disagreement. Out of 34 people, Zachary correctly predicts how 33 of them will choose a side after the disagreement.

There, of course, exist different ways to represent social networks. The way in which you choose to represent them depends on the question you're trying to answer. For example, one might imagine having two types of nodes in a network. One type of node will represent a person and another type of node will represent an event. An edge is drawn between a person and an event if a person attended a given event and person A is considered connected to person B if they both attended the same event. One such example of this is the \emph{Southern Women Dataset}.\cite{konect:southernwomen} This dataset is another example of a community detection problem because after analysis of the data, it was found that women in the group were split into two discrete subgroups.
